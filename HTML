<div id="Hello">
<h1>Hello</h1>
<div id="Features">
<h2>Featrues</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p>so this paragraph is a child of the body as it is enclosed in the body</p>
<div>
<p>so this paragraph is a child of the div element so therefore a grandchild of the body element</p>
</div>
<div>divs are good for seperating different parts of information to make it looks nicer</div>
<div><span>so you use this code to seperate two different parts of a centence</span>so that its seperate from this part</div>
<p>this makes things <em>italic</em>and this makes things <strong>bold</strong></p>
<p>and to make things <em>emphasize</em> text you do this</p>
<p>using the <small>tag makes the text smaller</small>like this</p>
<p>the HTML element <mark>defines text that should be marked or highlighted</mark></p>
<p>The HTML del element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text</p>
<p>for example my favourite colour is <del>pink</del> purple</p>
<p>and then to serperate things in a list downwards you use this<br></br>so now this line is below the other one</p>
<p>and to write an unordered list you do this</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
<li>C#</li>
</ul>
<p>and to write an ordered list you do this</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
<li>C#</li>
</ol>
<p>to change the colour of text you do this</p> 
<h3 style="color:rgb(37, 23, 132);">Change text colours</h3>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;"> To add a background colour on either a paragraph or heading you do it like this</p>
<p>and to set a border for a heading you do this</p>
<h1 style="border:2px solid violet;">Border colors</h1>
<p>In HTML, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form: rrggbb></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<h1 style="background-color:#758dd50;">758dd50</h1>
<h1>HTML links</h1>
<p>To make a Hpyerlink in HTML you need to do this:</p>
<a href="https://github.com/Camb8s">Visit my github</a>
<p>By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link</p>
<a href="https://github.com/Camb8s" target="_blank">My github in a new window or tab</a>
<a href="https://github.com/Camb8s" target="_self">This opens my github in the same window or tab as it was clicked</a>
<a href="https://github.com/Camb8s" target="_top">This opens my gihthub in the full body of the window</a>
<a href="https://github.com/Camb8s" target="_parent">This will open my github in the parent frame</a>
<p>Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used. In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes for example</p>
<p title="John 'shotgun' nelson"
<p>You can also change the size of headings with style attribute using the CSS font-size property for example</p>
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Font sizeing</h1>
<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Changing fonts</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">Now this is how you change which font you want to use</p>
<h style="text-align:center;">This is how you Center text</h>
<p>The HTML sub element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.</p>
<p>This is <sub>subscritped</sub> text</p>
<p>And <sup>superscripted</sup> text appears half a character above the line</p>
<p>The HTML blockquote element defines a section that is quoted from another source</p>
<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.</blockquote>
<p>And short quotes work like this:</p>
<p>WFF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
<p>For abbreviations:</p>
<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948</p>
